Rishi Bhrigu is acknowledged for employing this science to forecast the past, present, and future of any individual. His work, the Bhrigu Samhita, is renowned for its intricate compilation of all potential horoscopes that could exist in the universe, accompanied by specific predictions regarding past and future events. However, Bhrigu entrusts the ultimate prediction of an individual's destiny to the discernment of the astrologer, who must analyze the current circumstances of the seeker in order to provide meaningful insights.",
      "para2": "This final point provides a more comprehensive understanding of the astrology process, emphasizing that an individual's current circumstances play a crucial role in shaping their future, which cannot be predetermined. Now, the question arises: who is qualified to answer a \"DaivPrashna\" The Sanskrit term \"DaivPrashna\" combines \"Daiv\" and \"Prashna,\" translating to \"Fate\" and \"question,\" respectively. To predict fate, one must comprehend the purpose of an individual's existence, as their fate is the path leading to their specific reason or goal. At Daivprashna, we analyze the underlying reasons before forecasting an individual's fate, and, most importantly, we focus on providing solutions, which is more significant than simply predicting fate and leaving everything to luck and chance."
